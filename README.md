# DEISI25-Aws-Management-Portal

## Installation and Deployment

### Pre-requisites
- AWS Account with ROOT access (create one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/))
- Github Account
- Docker (download [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Operating system: Linux or Windows (with WSL 2)
    - Guide on how to run Docker with WSL 2:
      [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers)
    
### Operating System Compatibility
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Other linux based systems should work with no problem
- Windows with WSL should work as well

### Steps
#### 1. Getting the AWS Root Account Access Key
Navigate to [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) and login with the ROOT account.

In the top-right corner click in the account username and select __Security Credentials__.

Under __Access Keys__ select __Create access key__.

Take note of the __Access key__ and the __Secret access key__ as they will be required in the setup script.

#### 2. Create the `docker-compose.yml` file.
Open this [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/al3x-13/DEISI25-Aws-Management-Portal/main/docker-compose.yml) and
copy all the content inside and save it locally to a file named `docker-compose.yml`.

#### 3. Download Setup Script
Go to [this page](https://github.com/al3x-13/DEISI25-Aws-Management-Portal/releases) and download the binary
that matches your operating system. Save it in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Make sure the binary has `execute` permissions.

#### 4. Execute Setup Script
Execute the script and insert the requested info. These info will be used to create the config files the application
requires in order to run.
![Setup 4](assets/setup-4.png)

This is the output of the script if it ran successfully.
![Setup 5](assets/setup-5.png)

This are the files it generated.

__NOTE:__ In this script you'll be prompted to create password for 2 users (a ROOT user and a STANDARD user) that you can use to
test the application. This is temporary, while the user management functionality is not finished.

#### 5. Login to GHCR from Docker
In order to be able to pull the containers, we need to login into Gitub Container Registry (GHCR) from docker.

First we need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the required permissions. To do that navigate to the
following page [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and select `Generate new token
(classic)`.
![GHCR 1](assets/ghcr-1.png)

Then select the options `read:packages`, add a note (does not matter what) and generate the token.
![GHCR 2](assets/ghcr-2.png)

Copy the generated token, and then, in the terminal execute the following command `echo "GITHUB_TOKEN" | docker login
ghcr.io -u GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin` replacing `GITHUB_TOKEN` with the generated token.

#### 6. Run Docker Compose
To run the application we just need to run the following command on the terminal.
`docker compose up --build`

![Compose 1](assets/compose-1.png)
![Compose 2](assets/compose-2.png)

If no error was thrown, the application should be running.

#### 7. Ready to Go
To make sure the application is running, access the following url in the browser:
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

Now, you're able to login using the accounts setup in the setup script and test the application.
